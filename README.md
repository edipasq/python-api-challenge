API Homework
Here are some of the graphs and maps that my homework produces and the interpretation of each will be found below:

As the lattitude approaches 0 latitude the temperature increases in all seleted Cities.

In this Northen Hemisphere graph with temperature vs Latitud you can see as
you approach the North Pole the temperature decreases.

In this Southern Hemisphere you can see when you get closer to the South pole the temp decreases.

Wind speeds seems to increase at 60 degrees latitude. This may point to where the jet stream is located.

The majority hotels are close in latitude, during the summer months in the northen hemiphire the map places them far 
enough from the equator so the temperature is not too hot, yet close enough that the temperature is not too cold ether. 
This would change at different time of the year, like during winter months these hotels would probably 
be too cold to meet the same criteria.
